Le plan :

1) Problem description in dimension p.

2) How to solve this problem : OP -> PELT -> FPOP
Problem : if p > 1, FPOP cannot be used with an exact pruning (we need to build heuristic algorithms)

3) We need to approximate I \ U and we propose 3 solutions involving rectangle approximation in particular

4) Simulations
We plot the number of candidates and time for different data lengths and different dimensions.
We see that we get closer to the log-linear time complexity with strategy 2.

5) Particular case of dimension 2.

6) ... To continue...

Bon courage,

Vincent



This large computational cost is an increasingly important issue as every larger data sets are needed to be analysed.
